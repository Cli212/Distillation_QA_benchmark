# Distiller: A Systematic of Knowledge Distillation in NLP



## Description 

We aim to benchmark various distillation algorithms for QA and NER tasks. 

Code for experiements can be put in directory /src.

## Experiments

You can do KD experiments now using our code [here](experiments/). We only support experiments on QA tasks now but I am very confident that we will support NER tasks soon.

## Ray Tune

To use [ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/index.html) cluster to run the experiments, first

```shell
pip install -e .
```

then go to [ray_directory](ray_directory) 

## Dataset

For QA task, you can download SQuAD dataset (v1, v2) by using shell command:

``` shell
bash download_squad2.sh
```

For downloading other datasets, follow this: https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/tree/master/scripts/datasets/question_answering
